                        <h2 class="font-color mt-3">Introduction</h2>
                        <p class="font-color mt-5 ms-5 me-5">I started my carrer as a Branch Accountant for Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, which helped me develop skill to work on excel sheets & word files. 
                            During that time I had to dealt with enormous data, it included lot of paper work such as voucher filing, maintaining accounts, issuing cheque, checking bills, employee reimbursement <i>(sometimes 100's of cheque in day or 2)</i> etc, It was so much work load back then
                            that on every 10th day of the month I had to work till 2 AM.
                            <br> 
                            Banking was also the part of my job which included depoist of cash and cheque.
                            <br><br>
                            One good thing Bajaj had that they hired IT professionls for each offices accross India basically to resolve networking and hardware issues. What benefit I had might be your question?
                            Well that guy had eagerness to keeping himself updated with technologies, one fine evening he was sitting with me and asked what all I do, after learning all details of my work. <br><br>
                            Without letting me know he started working on a project <i>(not going through all details)</i> on completion he installed C based program on my office computer, which really reduced my work load to 3 hours a day.
                            <br><br>
                            Things software used to do for me:
                            <ul>
                                <li class="font-color ms-5">Generating data as per requirement in excel</li>
                                <li class="font-color ms-5">Voucher creation and printing</li>
                                <li class="font-color ms-5">Cheque printing</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-color ms-5 me-5">
                            That was my first real world experience of software. I did studied computers as an extra subject during my Uni days and secured 70% marks. 
                            I always thought that computer reduce so much time and it will be the future I am looking for but always went with the wind and continued to work
                            whatever was on my way. Time changed and I joined travel company (Destination Management) there we were doing everything on cloud based software.
                            I was again keen on learning and he taught basics of HTML. But finally I got a chance to learn it in year 2020 <i>(The break year)</i> and joined 
                            course on EDX - online platform <b>learning Web Dev with Python and JavaScript.</b> Still on learning drive and hope I am able to finish my tasks
                            and get what I am looking from the learning.
                        </p>

                            Truly speaking I just gave it a chance wonder happened, I am able to understand it easily, its probably Python is an easy language to understand. I got attracted to 
                            name Python and later searched and found its second top language in use.
